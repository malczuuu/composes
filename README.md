# Portainer Compose

Docker Compose configuration for [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer).

Portainer starts with `--no-auth` option, so this configuration not suitable for production
deployment.

**Note** that `Portainer` was not updated since `1.25.0`, because it's the latest version before
licensing change. Newer versions do not have `--no-auth` option. For personal purposes, version
`1.25.0` is enough.
