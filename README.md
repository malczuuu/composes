# Composes

[![Validate Docker Compose](https://github.com/malczuuu/composes/actions/workflows/validate-composes.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/malczuuu/composes/actions/workflows/validate-composes.yml)

Various `docker-compose.yaml` drafts used for local development.

**Note** that it's required to use Docker Compose v2, where `compose` is a subcommand of `docker`
instead of being separate `docker-compose` executable and `version` is no longer required in
`docker-compose.yaml` files.
